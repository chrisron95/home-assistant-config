This repo contains my latest [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io/) configuration. I'm Chris Heder, a proud nerd in South Florida. I've been working on this system as a hobby since roughly 2019 and it's grown exponentially since then. It all started with a simple Raspberry Pi setup that controlled only two lights, and over time has evolved to a virtual machine running on my old 2012 MacBook Pro that runs just about every aspect of the house, controlling every light, switch, fan, tv, etc. (details below).

This has been and will forever continue to be a fun hobby for me (hopefully I'll have a _true_ J.A.R.V.I.S. one day). I had a lot of help and inspiration to get where I am now (credits below) and I hope that in sharing my own configuration I can help inspire and help others who are setting up their own smart home.

In time, I plan on making some videos detaining some of the things I've implemented, as well as some cool new stuff I have on my to-do list. Follow me for updates as I do! Feel free to reach out on Twitter if you have any questions or comments, or just to say hi!

## Inspiration

I couldn't have gotten my setup to where it is now without the inspiration from a few fellow Home Assistant enthusiasts. Check out their links here:

### Jeffery Stone

- [His Site](https://slacker-labs.com)
- [His YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCipZJ6748kd8TbelSxcvcVg)

I also got the inspiration for my front-end from [SWAKES](https://github.com/pqpxo/SWAKES_hassio) and [matt8707](https://github.com/matt8707/hass-config). My front end is still very much a work in progress, but I hope to soon have that finalized so I can share that on here as well.
